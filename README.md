part1.s -> use Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to n provided [2-n] as array
part2_iterative.s -> compute nth pell number iteratively
part2_recursive.s -> compute nth pell number recursively 
part3_a.s -> implement bubble sort
part3_b.s -> implement selection sort

issues: selection sort and bubble sort have some incorrect behaviour depending on array composition, some clobbered registers.
