part1.s -> use Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to n provided [2-n] as array

part2_iterative.s -> compute nth pell number iteratively

part2_recursive.s -> compute nth pell number recursively 

part3_a.s -> implement bubble sort

part3_b.s -> implement selection sort

issues: iterative pell fails for n=2, selection sort fixed but untested
